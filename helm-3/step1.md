# Installing

The first step is to install Helm on your environment.
In this scenario you're going to use [snap](https://snapcraft.io/).

`sudo snap install helm --classic`{{execute}}

Snaps can be used on all major Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian and Fedora.
If your OS doesn't support snap, there are other ways to [install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Checking

Now you can check that Helm is correctly installed.

`helm version`{{execute}}
